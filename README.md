# Retro-Gameboy-Project

## A Retro-Gameboy that has Tetris coded in C++

This project was built alongside three team mates. I was in charge of programming an Arduino to
run a game, much like a DIY Gameboy. I programmed the game Tetris in C++ utilizing Object Oriented Programming
Concepts (OOP). My team mates 3D printed the shell and connected the circuitry.

A link to the video demonstration is here:

## How to run the game
Coming soon!
